## Morse code encoder

This is a simple program which takes user input string and returns the encoded morse code.

## Logic

- Mapped all the codes and used reverse mapping to decode the text to ensure the correct encoding is done.
- Didn't add any input option to enter morse code and decode cuz I don't really know morse code that well yet, so just encoding works.
- this was fun ;)


## To run

Simply clone the repo and run it in your IDE (capable of running Java).
